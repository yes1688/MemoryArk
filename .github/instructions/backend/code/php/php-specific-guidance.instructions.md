# PHP Design and Syntax Guidelines

This guideline compiles PHP-specific design principles, syntax conventions, and best practices.

## Design Principles
- Follow PSR standards (PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4, etc.).
- Prefer type hints and strict types.
- Make good use of namespaces and autoloading.
- Avoid global variables and side effects.
- Use Composer to manage dependencies.

## Syntax Conventions
- Use consistent camelCase or snake_case for variable, function, and class names.
- Use modern syntax (such as anonymous functions, arrow functions, type declarations, etc.).
- Use exception handling and error control appropriately.
