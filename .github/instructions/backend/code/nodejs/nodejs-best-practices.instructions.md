# Node.js Best Practices

This guideline compiles Node.js development design principles, syntax conventions, and best practices.

## Design Principles
- Use async/await to manage asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell.
- Properly handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections.
- Use worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks.
- Implement appropriate logging strategies for monitoring and diagnostics.
- Organize code structure following modular principles.

## Syntax Conventions
- Use ES6+ syntax (let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, etc.).
- Import modules using import/export or require.
- Use camelCase for variable, function, and class names.
