# Node.js/TypeScript Refactoring Best Practices

This guideline compiles Node.js/TypeScript-specific refactoring principles and common patterns.

## Refactoring Recommendations
- Use async/await and Promises for asynchronous refactoring.
- Apply modular design; split large files and responsibilities.
- Use TypeScript types appropriately to improve maintainability.
- Use linter and formatter tools for automated refactoring.
- Avoid callback hell; prefer modern syntax.

## Common Refactoring Patterns
- Extract shared modules, service layers, and middleware.
- Refactor asynchronous flows and event-driven designs.
- Use dependency injection and refactor for testability.
