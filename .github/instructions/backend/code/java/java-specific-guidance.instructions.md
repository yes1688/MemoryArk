# Java Design and Syntax Guidelines

This guideline compiles Java-specific design principles, syntax conventions, and best practices.

## Design Principles
- Follow Java Coding Conventions and the Google Java Style Guide.
- Make good use of interfaces, abstract classes, and generics.
- Prefer immutable objects and encapsulation.
- Use exception handling appropriately, distinguishing between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Adopt unit testing and automated testing.

## Syntax Conventions
- Use camelCase for class, method, and variable names.
- Use standard annotations (such as @Override, @Nullable, etc.).
- Leverage Stream API and lambda expressions.
