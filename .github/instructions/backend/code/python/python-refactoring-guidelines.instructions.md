# Python Refactoring Best Practices

This guideline compiles Python-specific refactoring principles and common patterns.

## Refactoring Recommendations
- Follow PEP8 and PEP20; keep code simple and clear.
- Split large modules and functions, focusing on single responsibility.
- Make good use of type annotations and automated testing.
- Appropriately use classes, decorators, and context managers.
- Use pylint, black, and isort tools to assist refactoring.

## Common Refactoring Patterns
- Extract shared functions, classes, and modules.
- Optimize exception handling and data flow.
- Reduce global variables and side effects.
