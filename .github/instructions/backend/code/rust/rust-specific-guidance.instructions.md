# Rust Design and Syntax Guidelines

This guideline compiles Rust-specific design principles, syntax conventions, and best practices.

## Design Principles
- Prefer immutable variables and ownership mechanisms to ensure memory safety.
- Make good use of the type system and pattern matching to enhance robustness.
- Use traits and generics for abstraction and reuse.
- Avoid excessive use of unsafe; keep code in safe blocks as much as possible.
- Use the crate ecosystem to manage dependencies.

## Syntax Conventions
- Use snake_case for variable, function, and module names.
- Use CamelCase for types, structs, and enums.
- Use match, Result, and Option for error and branch handling.
