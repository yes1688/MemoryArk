# OOP/SOLID Principles (For OOP Languages: PHP, Java, C# Only)

This guideline applies only to OOP languages: PHP, Java, and C#.

## Principle Descriptions
- Follow SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
- Prefer object-oriented design patterns (such as Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.).
- Avoid excessive inheritance; favor composition over inheritance.
- Interfaces and abstract classes should have clearly defined responsibilities.
- Reduce coupling, and enhance modularity and testability.
