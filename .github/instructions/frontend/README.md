# Frontend Instruction Structure Guide

This directory is organized according to copilot-instructions-frontend.md and frontend-instructions-structure.md, divided into common/ (general principles) and code/ (framework-specific best practices).

- common/: Applies to all JS/TS/TSX/Vue/Angular projects, covering architecture, SOLID, refactoring, performance, error handling, and more.
- code/: Framework-specific best practices, refactoring, performance, and error handling guidelines for React, Vue, Angular, etc.

Please select the appropriate instruction file based on your project type. For pure JS/TS/TSX projects, refer mainly to common/. For framework projects, prioritize the corresponding files under code/.
