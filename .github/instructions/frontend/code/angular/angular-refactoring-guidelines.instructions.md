# Angular Refactoring Guidelines

- Component refactoring: Split large components into presentational and container components
- Service extraction: Move business logic from components to services
- Module splitting: Create feature modules and shared modules
- Directive optimization: Replace complex logic with custom directives
- State management: Refactor to NgRx when state complexity increases
- Use Angular CLI for automated refactoring (ng generate/update)
