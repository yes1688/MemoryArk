# Database Query Optimization (General)

- SQL queries: Avoid SELECT *, use indexes, avoid full table scans, use pagination queries, optimize JOINs, convert subqueries to JOINs, avoid functions in WHERE clauses.
- NoSQL queries: Analyze query patterns, use compound indexes, avoid cross-partition queries, use batch operations, cursor-based pagination.
