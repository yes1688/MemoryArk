# MemoryArk 2.0 Public Assets

This directory contains static assets that will be served directly by the web server.

## Files:
- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon (church icon)
- `logo.png` - Application logo
- `robots.txt` - Search engine crawler instructions

## Notes:
- All files in this directory are served at the root path
- Large media files should be stored in the backend, not here
- These files are copied as-is during the build process
